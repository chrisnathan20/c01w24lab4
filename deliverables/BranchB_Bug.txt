Frontend:
1. The deleteNote function was setting the Content-Type header for a DELETE request, which is unnecessary as the request does not include a body.
2. The application state was not updated after a successful delete operation (did not call deleteNoteState)

Backend:
1. The endpoint did not interact with the database to attempt note deletion and always returned a 500 Internal Server Error (unimplemented functionality)
2. The endpoint did not assign note ID correctly, and did not validate the note ID
3. The endpoint lacked proper error handling and meaningful response messages based on the actual result of the delete operation
